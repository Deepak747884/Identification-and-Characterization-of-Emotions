"Some Bayern stars wanted Kovac gone, reveals Hoeness",[],"football

Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness has revealed club bosses decided to part company with head coach Niko Kovac because some of their stars wanted him out. Kovac, 48, was dismissed by Bayern last Sunday in the wake of a 5-1 thrashing at Eintracht Frankfurt.

Interim coach Hansi Flick oversaw a 2-0 home win over Olympiakos in midweek, with Bayern qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League with two games left, and Saturday’s 4-0 league thrashing of Dortmund at the Allianz Arena.

Kovac won the Bundesliga and cup double last season, but was sacked after 16 months and Hoeness confirmed to broadcasters ZDF late Saturday the Croatian coach had lost the backing of his dressing room.

“There were certainly elements within the team that wanted the coach gone,” revealed Hoeness without naming who, although forward Thomas Mueller had said he was unhappy to be repeatedly benched by Kovac.

“That’s why the club leaders reacted accordingly.”

Hoeness said Kovac himself admitted it was “the right decision” to part company.

In an interview with Sky earlier, Hoeness said he remains in contact with Kovac, “as far as I am concerned, the coaches almost always leave as friends. He’s not happy, of course, but I think he’s also relieved.”

Hoeness, who will step down after a decade as Bayern president on Friday at the club’s annual general meeting, said “absolutely no decision has been made” as to who will replace Kovac.

Both Hoeness and club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge hinted after Saturday’s game Flick would stay on past the November 23 deadline - Bayern’s next league game - which Hoeness had set as a date to announce a new head coach.

Both Ajax coach Erik ten Hag, who coached Bayern’s reserves from 2013-15, and Paris Saint Germain’s German coach Thomas Tuchel have said they will not leave their respective clubs this season.

Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has also criticised Bayern’s lack of discretion for putting out a statement saying they turned him down.

The 70-year-old Frenchman insists he spoke to Rummenigge by phone and only expressed interest in the job in a brief conversation when the pair agreed to speak again next week.

“I think we both misunderstood and I am sorry for that,” Rummenigge told reporters, adding he will phone Wenger in the coming days to “clear this thing up”.

With two wins under Flick, Bayern have time during the upcoming international window, “which we need to get a clear idea what we want”, said Hoeness, adding the goal must be a “long-term solution”.

“Until such a solution comes, I am of the opinion that Hansi Flick is not a bad solution.”",https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/11/10/Pictures/germany-soccer-bayern-kovac_54d92b16-03c9-11ea-8324-1e09595151a0.jpg,[],https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/some-bayern-stars-wanted-kovac-gone-reveals-hoeness/story-cC8JA1QC3zWrSxuMKion1I.html,2019-11-10T02:51:30
"Rs 8000 ticket drives away Pakistan people from exhibition match featuring Luis Figo, Kaka, Carles Puyol",['Press Trust Of India'],"football

Legendary footballers Luis Figo, Kaka, Carles Puyol and Nicolas Anelka were disappointed to see a sparse crowd turn up for their exhibition match in Karachi, which is part of an initiative to promote the game in Pakistan.

The six-a-side exhibition game which was held at the Rahat Stadium on Saturday between Kaka XI and local side, Karachi FC, saw just a few hundred people in attendance.

Many attributed it to the expensive pricing of tickets which were sold at 8000 rupees each.

“It is to uplift the sport of football in Pakistan,” World Soccer Stars organiser Robert Head said in a statement.

The players have been brought to Pakistan for the second time in two years by the World Stars organizers but the present visit appears to have drawn little response or appreciation from the football fans in the country.

One reason could be the lack of international exposure for the national team players as presently a committee of FIFA is managing football affairs in the country.

“We want to contribute to football (in Pakistan) in any way we can,” said Kaka at a news conference.

“This is the first step towards that.”",https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/11/10/Pictures/russia-v-brazil-international-friendly_191793aa-03b6-11ea-a362-a76bed49e6ea.jpg,[],https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/rs-8000-ticket-drives-away-pakistan-people-from-exhibition-match-featuring-luis-figo-kaka-carles-puyol/story-eUXlydThDQ2TJ6EUBmCJwN.html,2019-11-10T12:40:37
"Cristiano Ronaldo hasn’t scored a free-kick in almost 2 years, Lionel Messi hits two in single game",['Ht Correspondent'],"football

Updated: Nov 10, 2019 17:08 IST

The comparisons between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo refuse to die down as both superstars continue to be talismans for their teams. However last night, Messi proved one thing that he is the best free-kick taker in the world right now. Barcelona have been in poor form recently but Messi made sure that his club stay in touching distance of the La Liga top spot.

Messi scored a wonderful hat-trick against Celta Vigo at Camp Nou to help his side get a 4-1 win in La Liga. Along the way, Messi equalled Ronaldo’s record of most hat-tricks in La Liga history (34).

Messi scored two free-kicks during the game as Barcelona stopped their winless streak. Just at the stroke of half-time, Messi scored a sensational free kick from 25 yards out, that curled over the wall into the right corner of the goal-post. Only a few minutes later, Messi hit another free-kick in the top corner to complete his hat-trick. While Messi has hit numerous free-kicks in recent times, Ronaldo last scored from free-kick 694 days ago.

Messi’s contract will expire in 2021 and Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu revealed that the club will offer Messi a lifetime contract to see out his career at Camp Nou.

“Over the next two or three seasons our leader will continue to be Messi,” Bartomeu said during an interview with Associated Press. “However, there will be other young players coming in. Some will come from abroad, some will come from La Masia. We are content because we are preparing for the post-Messi era.”

‘I always make a comparison with Pelé,’ explained Bartomeu. ‘Pelé was a man from only one club [in Brazil]... [and] I have no doubt that after Messi ends his career as a footballer, he will remain linked to this club for the rest of his life,’ Bartomeu insisted.

‘Leo Messi’s contract ends in 2021,’ he went on. ‘But it will surely be the will of all parties involved, if they feel strong and ambitious, to extend this contract indefinitely,’ finished Bartomeu emphatically.

Bayern brush aside off-field woes to thrash Dortmund in ‘Klassiker’,['Press Trust Of India'],"football

Updated: Nov 10, 2019 13:37 IST

Managerless Bayern Munich thrashed Borussia Dortmund 4-0 in ‘Der Klassiker’ as Robert Lewandowski continued his phenomenal scoring run with two goals at the Allianz Arena.

Lewandowski’s first-half header and 76th-minute tap-in mean he has scored in all of Bayern’s Bundesliga and Champions League games this season for a tally of 23 goals.

Serge Gnabry claimed Bayern’s second, while visiting captain Mats Hummels scored a late own goal for his former club as Dortmund suffered another heavy defeat in Munich, where they also lost 5-0 in April.

Bayern’s moved up to third, level on points with second-placed RB Leipzig and one behind leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach, who host Werder Bremen Sunday.

Interim coach Hansi Flick enjoyed his second win in charge since Niko Kovac was sacked last Sunday.

However, Bayern are having difficulties finding a new coach, with Arsene Wenger on Saturday contradicting their claims they turned him down as Kovac’s successor and slammed the club for a lack of discretion.

Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who spoke to Wenger last week, cancelled a pre-match interview with Sky.

Ajax coach Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel have already made it clear they will not join Bayern this season.

Despite their off-field troubles, Bayern bounced back from last weekend’s 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt as Lewandowski scored with a superb header from a Benjamin Pavard cross on 17 minutes.

Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho was hooked off on 36 minutes after failing to make an impact on proceedings.

Gnabry had a goal ruled out for offside as Bayern went in 1-0 up at the break, but the Germany winger struck two minutes into the second half.

When Lewandowski stumbled with the goal at his mercy, Gnabry fired home.

With an hour gone and his side 2-0 down, Dortmund coach Lucien Favre brought on forwards Marco Reus and Paco Alcacer, who have only just recovered from foot and calf injuries respectively.

Alcacer had his head in his hands after failing to connect with an Achraf Hakimi cross with 20 minutes left as Dortmund’s best chance went begging.

Bayern’s third came as Lewandowski finished another counter-attack by the hosts, just before Hummels’ own goal.

Leipzig go second

Earlier, Timo Werner netted twice as Leipzig went second with a 4-2 win at Hertha Berlin in the capital, where the Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989.

To mark the 30th anniversary, a replica of the Wall, which divided Germany’s capital from 1961, separated Hertha and Leipzig before being knocked down prior to kick-off.

Midfielder Maximilian Mittelstaedt gave Hertha a first-half lead which lasted six minutes before Werner converted a penalty after his hat-trick in last weekend’s 8-0 thrashing of Mainz.

Marcel Sabitzer added Leipzig’s second on the stroke of half-time before three goals came in the final five minutes.

Kevin Kampl netted Leipzig’s third with a superb left-footed strike before Werner grabbed his second for his 11th league goal in as many games, before Hertha striker Davie Selke scored against his former club.

Striker Rouwen Hennings completed his hat-trick five minutes from time as Fortuna Duesseldorf held Schalke to a 3-3 draw.

The Royal Blues squandered the lead three times as goals by Daniel Caligiuri, Ozan Kabak and Suat Serdar in Gelsenkirchen were cancelled out by Hennings.

Union Berlin are up to 11th after their third straight win as Sebastian Anderson scored twice in a 3-2 victory at Mainz.

Lionel Messi equals Cristiano Ronaldo’s huge La Liga record with a hat-trick,['Ht Correspondent'],"football

Updated: Nov 10, 2019 12:14 IST

Despite the fact former Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo has been with Serie A club Juventus since July 2018, his rivalry with Barcelona star forward Lionel Messi continues. On Saturday, Messi registered a hat-trick against Celta Vigo at Camp Nou to help his side get a 4-1 win in a La Liga match. In doing so, Messi equalised Ronaldo’s record of player with most hat-tricks in La Liga history (34).

The Argentine forward converted a kick from the spot in the 22nd minute to get his goal. Later, Messi took a sensational free kick from 25 yards out, that curled over the wall into the right corner of the goal-post, just at the stroke of half time. Two minutes into the second half, the Barca star converted another free-kick in a similar fashion to complete his hat-trick.

With Ronaldo no longer with Real Madrid, it is highly likely Messi would go on to surpass the Portuguese international and stand sole at the top spot in the record books. It was also Messi’s 427th goal in the Spanish league.

“We have a very big advantage, we have the best player in the world on our side who is also the best at taking free kicks,” Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets praised Messi after the match. “Little by little he has been improving at free kicks, he used to find them hard. Having him around gives us a real boost,” he added.

With the win, the defending Spanish Champions reached back to take the top spot in the table, tied at 25 points with Real Madrid, but with a better goal difference.

Meanwhile, Real Madrid too picked up a big win on Saturday as they defeated Eibar in an away game. A brace from Karim Benzema, a goal from defender Sergi Ramos and a goal from Federico Valverde saw Real winning the game 4-0 comfortably.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/11/10/Pictures/_ac0d7f58-0384-11ea-bb04-d92b2c522640.jpg,['https://www.youtube.com/embed/bheqPBjrzAw'],https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/lionel-messi-equals-cristiano-ronaldo-s-huge-la-liga-record-with-a-hat-trick/story-sIxWnjsSHYyEkTzptyfNNI.html,2019-11-10T06:44:13

Leicester opened up a nine-point lead over Arsenal in the battle for Champions League qualification and moved second in the Premier League with a 2-0 win over the Gunners on Saturday. Jamie Vardy and James Maddison were the architects of another fine victory for the Foxes as the English duo struck in the space of seven second-half minutes. Arsenal are now eight points adrift of the top four and will fall even further behind should Manchester City avoid defeat away to league leaders Liverpool on Sunday.

In the face of mounting speculation over his future, Emery surprisingly maintained Mesut Ozil alongside the front two of new captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. That bold strategy nearly paid off when Lacazette fired the first big chance of the match inches wide after Aubameyang had burrowed his way into the area.

Thereafter, it was Leicester who had all the better chances to break the deadlock. Vardy failed to connect with Ayoze Perez’s dangerous cross before Maddison curled a free-kick inches wide. Wilfred Ndidi was next to miss a glorious chance when he smashed off the crossbar with the goal gaping from Ricardo Pereira’s cutback four minutes into the second half.

Arsenal were the first to put the ball in the net when Aubameyang supplied a characteristically clinical finish but was rightly flagged offside.

Vardy has an excellent record against Arsenal and when his chance came, the Premier League’s top scorer was ruthless with a low finish past Bernd Leno from Youri Tielemans’s pass.

The former England striker then turned provider as he laid the ball back into the path of Maddison to drill a low shot in from outside the box. Arsenal offered precious little after going behind and have now won just two of their last 10 league games.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/11/10/Pictures/premier-league-leicester-city-v-arsenal_09e10d48-036c-11ea-bb04-d92b2c522640.jpg,[],https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/premier-league-jamie-vardy-james-maddison-pull-leicester-city-further-clear-of-arsenal/story-cIZCwNWsK6bkV5btXS703N.html,2019-11-10T03:43:32
Tottenham slip to 12th after being held by Sheffield United,['Agence France-Presse'],"football

Updated: Nov 09, 2019 23:54 IST

Tottenham surrendered a lead for the third straight Premier League game as Sheffield United moved up to fifth with a thoroughly deserved 1-1 draw at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday.

Son Heung-min’s strike just before the hour mark threatened to get Spurs out of jail, especially after a controversial VAR ruled out David McGoldrick’s equaliser moments later.

But George Baldock’s cross that found a way through into Paulo Gazzaniga’s net did survive a VAR review to level 12 minutes from time.

Tottenham looked back in the groove as they swept aside Red Star Belgrade 4-0 in the Champions League in midweek for their first away win in any competition since May.

However, Pochettino’s men fell back into the bad habits that have characterised a poor Premier League campaign as they slip to 12th on the back of a run of two wins in 11 games.

Spurs defender Eric Dier was booked after just 75 seconds for clattering into Baldock and the former England international was lucky not to be sent off inside 20 minutes for another foul on McGoldrick.

Dier’s unease was on show throughout a disjointed display from the hosts and they were lucky to escape on two occasions when John Lundstrum failed to turn home a dangerous low cross into the box before the midfielder smashed a shot off the post.

Son was free to play after his red card in the incident that saw Everton’s Andre Gomes suffer a broken ankle last weekend was rescinded.

Once again the South Korean was by a distance Tottenham’s most dangerous player and forced Dean Henderson into his first serious save early in the second half.

United started the game with the joint best defensive record in the league, but a rare slip from Enda Stevens presented Son with a glorious chance and his deflected shot squeezed through Henderson’s legs.

Just 129 seconds later, United were celebrating an equaliser as McGoldrick converted Stevens’ cross at the far post.

However, after a painstakingly long check, Lundstram’s toe was ruled offside.

The Blades got the slice of fortune they deserved when Baldock’s miscued his cross but it ended up bending in at the far post.

Spurs had a late flurry in an attempt to take the three points, but Henderson was on hand to tip over Lucas Moura’s effort and the home fans roundly booed their team off at the final whistle.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/11/09/Pictures/premier-league-tottenham-hotspur-v-sheffield-united_61e4082c-0319-11ea-bb04-d92b2c522640.jpg,[],https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/tottenham-slip-to-12th-after-being-held-by-sheffield-united/story-KJaCN5uDUmmPtLjTfLprYN.html,2019-11-09T06:24:32

It has certainly not been a good time for Barcelona. The Blaugurana are struggling to fire on all cylinders in the La Liga as well in the Champions League. They have been looking towards Lionel Messi for answers. While the little magician has been able to win some matches for the Catalans, things still look bleak for them. Barcelona were defeated by Levante in the La Liga before Slavia Praha earned a 0-0 draw at Camp Nou.

There have been concerning reports that Messi is not on talking terms with new signing Antoine Griezmann. There has been speculation regarding Messi’s future at Camp Nou also.

ISL 2019: ATK crush Jamshedpur 3-1 to climb to top spot,['Press Trust Of India'],"football

Two-time former champions ATK continued their dream run and beat Jamshedpur FC 3-1 to climb to the top of the Indian Super League (ISL) standings here on Saturday. On a rain-hit evening with cyclone ‘Bulbul’ making a landfall near the West Bengal coastline, the home side dominated the proceedings and took a 2-0 lead with Fijian star forward Roy Krishna converting from the spot in the 57th and 71st minutes.

Sergio Castel reduced the margin for Jamshedpur FC in the 85th minute with yet another penalty after Anas Edathodika brought down Noe Acosta in an ugly challenge inside the box.

Castel buried that with ease but the visitors failed to equalise and it was Edu Garcia who sealed the deal with a magnificent finish (90+2nd minute) at the Salt Lake Stadium.

David Williams made an excellent cross-field ball from the right towards Roy Krishna who put it into the path of Garcia on his first touch.

Garcia took a few touches to get close to the goalkeeper and chipped it brilliantly into the net to end Jamshedpur’s unbeaten run in their first away match this season.

The Antonio Lopez Habas-coached side, who endured a disappointing start losing at Kerala 2-1 in the ISL-6 opener, thus secured a hat-trick of wins. They thrashed Hyderabad FC 5-0 before a hard-fought 1-0 away win against Chennaiyin FC in their previous match.

The Kolkata franchise have nine points from four matches to occupy the top spot, ahead of FC Goa (eight points).

Jamshedpur FC were pushed to fourth place with seven points from four matches.

Players of both the teams found it difficult to keep their balance as it rained incessantly through the day.

ATK conceded only one chance in the entire half, but it was the biggest of the game, as Farukh Choudhary’s header came off the crossbar early in the eighth minute.

Except for that, the ATK front-line has been top-notch, putting immense pressure on Subrata Paul and charged him down on every possible opportunity.

David Williams also had a chance in the 19th minute but his header went wide of goal.

Prabir Das, on the right, and Michael Soosairaj on the left, kept troubling Jamshedpur FC all along, only to miss the target.

Chelsea go second in Premier League with sixth win on the trot,['Agence France-Presse'],"football

Updated: Nov 09, 2019 20:57 IST

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard insisted his side’s target is still to reduce the gap on title favourites Liverpool and Manchester City, despite leapfrogging City into second place with a sixth straight Premier League win on Saturday.

The in-form Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic struck in the second half to beat Crystal Palace 2-0 at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea edge a point clear of City and to within five of leaders Liverpool, who host City in a highly-anticipated clash on Sunday.

“We respect where Liverpool and Manchester City are. That was the gap to try and bridge in some way going into the season,” Lampard told BT Sport on the possibility of a title challenge. “We are just happy with what we’re doing.”

A 4-4 draw with Ajax on Tuesday took the tally of goals in Chelsea’s prior 18 games this season to 70 at an average of nearly four per game.

However, the Blues free flowing football was met with a brick wall of a Palace defence for the first 45 minutes.

“I was a little bit frustrated as I felt we allowed the tempo to drop in the first half,” added Lampard. “I felt if we increased the tempo the game was there to win.”

Pulisic had scored four goals in his last two Premier League games as the American begins to deliver on his £58 million ($74 million) price tag and only a fine save from Vicente Guaita denied the USA captain another strike early on.

Thereafter, Chelsea were largely restricted to efforts from free-kicks on the edge of the box before the break as Willian curled inches wide.

Gary Cahill was making his return to Stamford Bridge after his seven years as a Chelsea player came to an end in the summer.

And Cahill reminded his former employers of why he won eight trophies for the club with a brilliant block to repel Willian’s goalbound effort in first half stoppage time.

The Palace resistence was finally broken by one moment of genius from Willian as Chelsea’s captain for the day flicked the ball perfectly into Abraham’s path to slot home his 10th Premier League goal of the season and join Leicester’s Jamie Vardy as the top scorer in the division.

Abraham is just one of a host of youngsters who have shone since being handed his chance in the first team by Lampard.

“The number nines that have been at Chelsea are world class strikers. I felt ready in myself and I’m proud of myself,” said Abraham.

Pulisic tested Guaita again with a rising drive shortly after that the Spaniard did brilliantly to tip over. But Guaita was helpless 11 minutes from time when Pulisic finally got the goal his performance deserved by following up after Michy Batshuayi’s shot had been blocked to nod home.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/11/09/Pictures/premier-league-chelsea-v-crystal-palace_b815fad0-0304-11ea-bb04-d92b2c522640.jpg,[],https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/chelsea-go-second-in-premier-league-with-sixth-win-on-the-trot/story-88na9HXSHff55cBkOkSXJI.html,2019-11-09T03:27:36
"Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson out of Liverpool clash, says Pep Guardiola",[],"football

Updated: Nov 08, 2019 23:49 IST

Manchester City keeper Ederson will miss Sunday’s Premier League match against leaders Liverpool due to a muscle injury with Claudio Bravo set to replace him in goal, manager Pep Guardiola said on Friday.

Ederson, who leads the Premier League with five clean sheets this season, was forced off at halftime in Wednesday’s 1-1 Champions League draw at Atalanta and the Brazilian was seen walking with a limp after the game.

Bravo was sent off late in the game, forcing City to play defender Kyle Walker in goal for the final 10 minutes, but Guardiola said he trusted the experienced Chilean to deliver in the top-of-the-table clash.

“He (Ederson) is not able to play on Sunday. We have another top goalkeeper, Claudio Bravo can do it too,” Guardiola told reporters.

“We won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup thanks to Claudio Bravo. He’s an exceptional goalkeeper... an international goalkeeper. I have no doubts.

“I see him every day in training. We won’t lose because of Claudio. The red card the other day was because we lost the ball. Respect the guy, he’s an incredible top goalkeeper.”

Liverpool and City played out a goalless draw at Anfield last season and though some questioned Guardiola for City’s defensive mindset, he said it was a consequence of adapting to Liverpool’s strategy.

“Sometimes you want to adapt to teams as good as Liverpool,” Guardiola said. “Sometimes people have to recognise that we are playing the champions of Europe. Being defensive was not the plan, it was so good that they pushed us deep.

“They do everything well. You see the team, what is the weak point? They are a real complete team and we need this kind of rival.”

A win for Liverpool will see them extend their lead over the defending champions to nine points and Guardiola said that if that were the case, it would become tougher to reel in Juergen Klopp’s side that lost only one game last season.

“I think in November it (the title race) never ends,” he added. “I know what is going to happen if we lose... I think we have a lot of games to play, a lot.

“It will be more difficult of course. If you see Liverpool, they lost one game last season and this season they are unbeaten. So you can imagine or think they are not going to lose many games.

"Kerala Blasters, Odisha FC settle for a point as injuries take a toll",['Indo Asian News Service'],"football

Updated: Nov 08, 2019 23:42 IST

Kerala Blasters FC remained without a win for the third consecutive match in the Indian Super League (ISL) following a goalless draw against Odisha FC at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Friday.

The contest was marred by injuries to key players from both teams as Jairo Rodriguez, Raphael Messi Bouli and Aridane Santana had to be substituted in the first half. The changes affected the pace of the game that ultimately ended without a winner.

Blasters and Odisha now have four points each from as many games and occupy the fifth and sixth position on the league table, respectively.

Blasters, who were already hampered by injuries this season, suffered a major blow in the fourth minute when captain Jairo Rodriguez went down injured. He was replaced by Abdul Hakku.

However, the home side continued to press high up the field to try and take the game to their opponents, but Odisha were well organised at the back.

A cautious period of play early on came to a halt when a head-on collision inside the box following a corner-kick left Aridane Santana and Messi Bouli requiring medical attention. Following a long pause, the game resumed with Mohammed Rafi and Carlos Delgado replacing the injured players.

With both teams struggling to create clear-cut chances, Sahal Abdul Samad took matters into his own hands as he embarked on a stellar solo run after picking up the ball from the right flank. The midfielder outfoxed three defenders before Narayan Das brought him down inside the box, but the referee rejected vociferous appeals for a penalty.

Blasters were the better side in the first half, although by fine margins. Mohammed Rafi’s drilled cross into the box from the right was met by Rahul KP whose audacious volley failed to test goalkeeper Francisco Dorronsoro.

The teams struggled to raise the tempo and keep hold of the ball after the break as well. Odisha threatened when Jerry Mawihmingthanga’s cross put T.P. Rehenesh in a spot of bother. The goalkeeper spilled the ball inside the box but Nandhakumar Sekar hit the rebound into the side-netting.

There were a couple more chances at either end as the game wound down, but a goal remained elusive.

With four minutes left, a Prasanth cross from the left was flicked towards the far post by second-half substitute Bartholomew Ogbeche for Rahul whose firm shot was kept out by Dorronsoro. Daniel Lalhlimpuia, at the other end, spurned a chance as well as both teams settled for a point.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/11/08/Pictures/_e8b494a6-0252-11ea-bb04-d92b2c522640.jpg,[],https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/kerala-blasters-odisha-fc-settle-for-a-point-as-injuries-take-a-toll/story-4k80qHPZxowNZpQdJ2xYlN.html,2019-11-08T06:12:29

Zlatan Ibrahimovic is set to rejoin Italian side AC Milan after his successful stint at LA Galaxy, Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber has said.

The 38-year-old Swedish striker has spent the past 18 months in MLS but his contract with Galaxy expires at the end of the year and he has been linked with a host of European clubs.

Ibrahimovic played for Milan between 2010 and 2012, scoring 42 goals in 61 league appearances, and Garber said he was on his way back to Serie A.

“Zlatan is such an interesting guy,” he told ESPN. “He keeps my hands full and my inbox full, but he’s a thrill-a-minute.

“He is a 38-year-old guy who is being recruited by AC Milan, one of the top clubs in the world.”

Ibrahamovic was named in the MLS Best XI in 2018 and 2019 after netting 53 goals in the competition.

Anthony Martial doubled the advantage after the half-hour mark with a brilliant individual goal, before Marcus Rashford lashed home the third four minutes after the interval.

“I think it was a good performance but there are things we can improve on,” Rashford told BT Sport.

Ntcham strikes

Ciro Immobile volleyed the hosts into a seventh-minute lead, but James Forrest drew Celtic level before half-time.
